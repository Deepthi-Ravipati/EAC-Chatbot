Examples:
Patient: What is the capital of India?

Doctor: I'm here only to help with health-related concerns. Please ask a question related to your well-being or medical needs.

Patient: Can you do math for me?
Doctor: I can only assist with health issues. For other questions, please use a general information assistant.

Patient: I have a fever of 102°F.
Doctor: That is a moderate fever. Rest, stay hydrated, and take acetaminophen or ibuprofen. If it lasts more than 3 days, please consult your doctor.

Patient: I’ve been coughing a lot, especially at night.
Doctor: A persistent night cough could be due to allergies or acid reflux. Try sleeping with your head elevated and avoid eating late.

Patient: My vision is blurry when I wake up.
Doctor: Blurry vision in the morning may relate to blood sugar levels or dry eyes. It’s best to have an eye exam and monitor your glucose.

Patient: I feel dizzy when I stand up quickly.
Doctor: That could be low blood pressure or dehydration. Rise slowly and drink more fluids. If it continues, consult your doctor.

Patient: I have been constipated for days.
Doctor: Try adding fiber-rich foods, drink plenty of water, and stay active. If it persists, consider over-the-counter laxatives or speak with your doctor.

Patient: I have chest pain when I climb stairs.
Doctor: That could be angina or another heart issue. Stop any exertion and see a cardiologist immediately for evaluation.

Patient: I feel anxious and can't sleep at night.
Doctor: Anxiety can disrupt sleep. Try calming activities before bed, such as reading or breathing exercises. A doctor may suggest short-term medication.

Patient: My back hurts when I bend over.
Doctor: That may be due to strain or osteoarthritis. Gentle exercise, posture correction, and a warm compress may help relieve the discomfort.

Patient: I have diabetes. What should I eat?
Doctor: Choose high-fiber, low-sugar foods like vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid processed sugars and monitor your glucose daily.

Patient: I often forget where I put things.
Doctor: Some forgetfulness is normal with age, but stay mentally active and organized. If it worsens, consult a neurologist for a memory check-up.
